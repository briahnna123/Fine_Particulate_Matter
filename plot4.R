NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds") # Bring in data
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Step 2: "Clean" the Data
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
NE_data <- tbl_df(NEI) # Usable data frame form w/ dplyr package
SC_data <- tbl_df(SCC)


# Step 3: Create the plot
png(filename= "plot3.png", width=480, height=480, units="px") # Set image format
